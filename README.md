# Census Prediction model using Machine_Learning

Predicting Census using Machine learning models (Decision trees and K-nearest neighbors)

Decision Trees : Decision tree learning is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning.
It uses a decision tree (as a predictive model) to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions 
about the item's target value (represented in the leaves).

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the simplest algorithms used in Machine Learning for regression and classification problem. 
KNN algorithms use data and classify new data points based on similarity measures (e.g. distance function). 
Classification is done by a majority vote to its neighbors.
